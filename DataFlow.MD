Sure, I'll add the real-world example to the markdown file. Here's the updated content:

# ⚠️ Important Notes:

## System Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- SQLite3 (included with Python)
- Sufficient disk space for LLM models

## Ollama Setup:
1. Install Ollama separately from: https://ollama.com
2. Pull required models:
   ```bash
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Start the MCP server
```bash
python server.py --server_type=sse
```

### Run the client
```bash
python langchain_client.py
```

## 🚀 Initialization Phase
1. Server starts and registers tools
2. Client connects to server
3. Client discovers available tools
4. Agent initializes with tools

## 💬 User Interaction Phase
When user types: “add Panama 55 year old as the SME”

1. Input goes to agent
2. Agent formats SQL query
3. Query passes to MCP tool
4. Tool executes on server
5. Result returns to user

## 🎯 Real-World Example
We often use Cursor IDE or Clause Desktop as MCP hosts, where the client relies on an external LLM (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.). While these tools are excellent, there are cases — especially when handling sensitive data — where fully secure and private MCP clients are essential. In our implementation, we created a MCP client powered by Local LLM which adds rows into a SQLite DB and selects rows from the SQLite (database management system) where:

### 📥 Adding Data
1. User requests to add a person
2. Agent formats SQL query
3. MCP tool executes query
4. Confirmation returns to user

### 📤 Reading Data
1. User requests to view records
2. Agent creates SELECT query
3. MCP tool fetches data
4. Results format in nice table

## 🛠️ Technology Stack for MCP Implementation
### 🐍 Python Framework & Libraries
- Python 3.x — Core programming language
- FastMCP — MCP server implementation
- LangChain — AI/LLM framework integration
- SQLite3 — Database management
- asyncio — Asynchronous I/O operations
- nest_asyncio — Nested event loop support

### 🤖 AI/LLM Integration
- Ollama — Local LLM model hosting (“llama3.2”)

### 🗃️ Database Layer
- SQLite — Lightweight database
  ```python
  def init_db():
      conn = sqlite3.connect('demo.db')
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      # Schema creation...
  ```

### 🔌 Communication Protocols
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) — Real-time updates
- MCP Protocol — Tool communication
  ```python
  server_config = {
      "default": {
          "url": f"{mcp_server_url}/sse",
          "transport": "sse",
          "options": {...}
      }
  }
  ```

```
